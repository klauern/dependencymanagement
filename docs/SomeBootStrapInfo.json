/*
 * In an attempt to make the bootstrapping 'look' cleaner, I'm looking into how
 * much work it would take to bootstrap indirectly by using a .json file instead.
 * This would at least provide some basic level of visibility into the data instead
 * of purely being repeated by method calls that are less-than-clear.
 *
 * I have not tested this feature, and I'm not sure how much work it would make
 * loading the information, but if I can make this work, then the next step would
 * be to pull out this type of information that we have housed somewhere else
 * (like the .csv file that we use for dependency management currently).
